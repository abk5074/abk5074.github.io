My work centers on understanding how power, control, and cultural dynamics shape contested fields—those economic or political arenas where the rules are unsettled and state & non‐state actors interact in complex ways. This work proceeds across three main areas. First, I study gray markets to understand how legal ambiguities reshape power dynamics, give rise to new forms of social control, and influence the practices of stigmatized organizations. Second, I analyze the cultural logics of ideological violence, exploring how terrorism operates within broader social frameworks and how these frameworks inform state-sanctioned punishment. Third, I investigate the privatization of punishment, examining how companies that contract with prisons commodify the carceral experience and how this commodification impacts incarcerated individuals, their families, and the public. I take an interpretive analytical appraoch to these topics and have expertise in formal models of cultural analysis, narrative analysis, and visual sociology.
