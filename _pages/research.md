My core research program is centered around studying contested fields and contentious politics. There are three main pillars of this effort. First, I conduct case studies of gray markets to understand how unsettled legal structure shifts power arrangements between state and non-state actors, leads to the emergence of new technologies of social control, and influences the practices of stigmatized organizations. Second, I analyze the cultural dynamics of ideological violence to reveal the comparative social logics of terrorism and to illuminate factors that lead to specific forms of state-sanctioned punishment. Third, I study private companies that contract with prisons to deliver essential services to understand how the commodification of the carceral experience exploits the incarcerated, their families, and the public. In my approach to these topics, I employ interpretive methods including formal models of cultural analysis, narrative analysis, and visual sociology. I have expertise in several approaches to computationally-assisted content analysis including topic modeling, correspondence analysis, and pictoral pattern analysis.
