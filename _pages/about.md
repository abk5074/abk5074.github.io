I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Sociology](https://www.oberlin.edu/arts-and-sciences/departments/sociology) at Oberlin College. In my work, I take a mixed-methods approach to studying contested markets, contentious politics, and punishment broadly conceived. Specifically, my work theorizes the institutional dynamics of stigmatized & stigmatizing economic behavior, ideological violence, and coercive confinement. 

My research has been published in *Social Problems*, *Poetics*, *Law & Policy*, *Crime & Delinquency*, *Sociological Inquiry*, *Sociological Perspectives*, *Sociological Focus*, *Policing*, & *Journal of School Violence*. My most recent article "Becoming a Cannabis Professional" was accepted for publication in [Sociological Inquiry](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/soin.12627). Please [email me](abk017@shsu.edu) if you would like preprint access.
