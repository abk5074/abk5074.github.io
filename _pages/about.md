Currently, I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology](https://www.shsu.edu/academics/cj-crim/) at Sam Houston State University. This fall, I will be joining [Oberlin College] (https://www.oberlin.edu/arts-and-sciences/departments/sociology) as an Assistant Professor of Sociology. As a trained sociologist, I take a mixed-methods approach to studying contested markets, contentious politics, and punishment. Broadly, my work theorizes the institutional dynamics of stigmatized & stigmatizing economic behavior, ideological violence, and coercive confinement. 

My research has been published in *Social Problems*, *Poetics*, *Law & Policy*, *Crime & Delinquency*, *Sociological Inquiry*, *Sociological Perspectives*, and *Sociological Focus*. My most recent article "Becoming a Cannabis Professional" was accepted for publication in [Sociological Inquiry](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/soin.12627). Please [email me](abk017@shsu.edu) if you would like preprint access.

I earned my B.A. in Letters, Arts, and Sciences from Penn State-Altoona and my M.A. and Ph.D. in Sociology from the University of Arizona.
