### The Integrative Social Sciences Research Lab (ISSRL)

The [ISSRL](https://altoona.psu.edu/story/61731/2023/11/28/altoona-criminal-justice-students-present-criminology-conference) is a multi-locational research team based out of Penn State Altoona and Sam Houston State University. The aim is to connect exceptional undergraduate students with graduate students to conduct rigorous research studies under the supervision of faculty advisors. Originally launched while I was an undergraduate student, I now co-facilitate the ISSRL with Dr. Nathan E. Kruis and Dr. Nicholas J. Rowland. This lab produces award winning undergraduate research that is presented at national and regional conferences. It also professionalizes students by facilitating peer-reviewed publishing opportunities, providing CV development support, workshopping statement of purpose letters, and creating opportunities for scholarly and practitioner networking.
